The next step is to add books you are willing to lend to your friends or family members. Then you invite them to join your group and also add their books. This way you create a "local private library" where you can track and lend each other books. It's a great way to discover what others are reading.

So you must first add some books that others can borrow from you. Only then will you be able to borrow books from other group members. However, there is a version of Shareyourbook that works like a normal library were members can borrow books that have been added by the group administrator without first adding their own books.

					<h2>About Share Your Book</h2>
					<p>I am currently pursuing my AS / A-Levels in Mathematics, Biology, Physics and Chemistry at New English School, Kuwait &amp; aspire to pursue an Engineering degree in the United States of America. I am passionate about different subjects related to STEM (Science / Technology / Engineering &amp; Maths) as well as Geography &amp; languages.</p>
					<p>I've been an avid reader for as long as I can remember. As a child, the school library was my favorite place and I always end up reading books more advanced for my age/class. I think one thing that influences our reading is the environment we grow up in as children. My parents weren't avid readers, but have always supported my reading habits. Books allow me to explore new worlds, vastly different to our own. When I read, magic comes to life, I don’t see words on a page; I become the characters themselves, living in worlds with cultures both fictional and similar to our own. None of the books are stories I relate to, but those that open up my mind to new experiences, culture, narrative etc.</p>
					<p>For many years, I have found hard to get physical books that suit my tastes in Kuwait. With only a single big bookstore in Kuwait, I used to eagerly wait for my summer vacation in India so I could visit my local bookstore in Chandigarh, or with help from my father; buying books from Amazon India &amp; getting them to Kuwait by asking his friends coming back from there to bring my books.</p>

					<p>Last summer (June – July ’19) I enrolled myself for a course in “Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine learning” where I learned to develop field using data sets, probability, statistics and more, with tools like Python and TensorFlow (which helps computers emulate the way the brain works) to turn yesterday's dreams into reality.</p>
					<p>Armed with this knowledge, I started working on this project that I had dreamt of for a long time which would help our local avid book readers to connect &amp; share on a single platform. Personally, I see my bookshelf stocked with books I’ve accumulated over the years and feel a sense of sadness. Some books lying there will never be read again as my tastes change. If a book isn’t read, then what is its purpose? As Henry Miller once said: “Books lying idle on a shelf is wasted ammunition. Like money, books must be kept in constant circulation" 
					</p>
					<p>“ShareYourBook.org” is a platform that brings local book lovers together to:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>share their paper books with friends and family for free</li>
						<li>save money</li>
						<li>protect the environment</li>
						<li>and read more </li>
					</ul>
			<p>Through this initiative, it can help students across all backgrounds / communities to gain access to and utilize such systems of learning This can be particularly useful for students to further their interests and deepen their knowledge on topics that may not study in their respective schools. Alumni of colleges can even pass down their used textbooks, if they’re in suitable condition, to new students to help save money and paper.</p>
			<h2>My Motivation</h2>
			<p>In the last 3 years during my summer vacation, while visiting my home town in Chandigarh, I have been working with “Youth Innovative Society” a Registered NGO formed in 2013 encouraging school children to create an ecological balance, planting more trees, refuse plastic bags &amp; encouraging “Girl Child” education in the society.</p>

			<p>Our aim was to help local government school students experience the delicate relationship biodiversity &amp; our community. It was a truly joyous experience to learn, interact, &amp; listen to the various stories of the students (some of whom were of my age) about their life &amp; future endeavors. What I realized during these interactions was, that as soon as we started our discussion around books, it always helped us to connect with the students as it would lighten their eyes. As most of the students in these schools came from an economically weak background, the only source for reading books was their school library, which usually had a very limited collections of books. Despite these odds, these students showed us their enthusiasm for learning and putting their best foot forward. Thereby giving us all a lesson for our life to strive forward despite all odds.
